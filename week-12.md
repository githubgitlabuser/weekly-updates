# Week 12 

- Will be off between half of week 12 to half of week 13. 

- Started implementing two track search for the program: 
  - keyword based (search with keywords) 
  - logic wiring based (look for logic and if there are callsites)
  
  This gives better control over what we are actually finding and also gives a good idea on the implementation status.
