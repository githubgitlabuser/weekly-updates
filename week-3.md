# Update of week 3

Week 3 was amazing! I arrived at Cannes on Saturday night and we all presented our project idea on Monday. 

Here are some points raised and discussed during the presentation relevant to my project:

- Keep in mind that EIPs are not static in nature. They evolve very quickly especially if they are being worked on now. 
- An EIP doesn't only exist in the github. It gets discussed in Discord, Telegram, Eth Magicians as well. So at any point what is the latest version is a bit hard to know.
- Some EIPs are dependent on other EIPs. This is something that needs to be taken into account. 
- One suggestion was to start with something where the difference is already known. I agree with this and it will be a good way to test or keep testing as I keep developing. 
- A suggestion from a fellow EPF fellow: use AI+manual strategy to rewrite the consensus specs to a more meaningful way: to have component-wise write-ups instead of hardfork-wise files. Also an explanation of the reasoning behind the choices. This is something I could work on as well in parallel or after the project is over. 

Apart from the EPF day above, here is a summary of what other things that I joined or experienced:

- On Sunday I attended the Beam day where I got a decent idea about the challenges beam tries to tackle as well as the future of beam. 
- During the weekdays I attended the libp2p workshop. It was interesting to know how pylibp2p is getting traction due to AI. Also the fact that the team has provision to teach someone about libp2p in order for that person to teach others in other conferences. 
- Another talk that stood out for me was the one related to chain abstraction. In order to truly get web3 to the next level, chain abstraction is potentially one of the most crucial aspects to get right. So that an end user doesn't have to know what underlying chain he is using but rather just the dapp should work fine. 
- I also attended a talk from Algorand. One crucial idea I heard was that Algorand can do atomic execution of 16 transactions at a time. So all or nothing for 16 transactions. I would like to explore it how they do it. 
- Another interesting talk was from Lagrange. They apply ZK proving in AI security. A good example of how innovation in one field can be applied in another field. ZK may not be mainstream in web3 yet but is already making waves in other fields. This reminds me of how several exploration initiative of NASA actually gave birth to cutting edge technologies which were very useful in other sectors. So even if space exploration may be optional for some, the technologies coming out of it definitely served humanity at scale. This is what excites me about web3 as a whole that in such a short period of time, so many types of technologies have emerged and are being explored at their respective forefront.
