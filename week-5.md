# Week 5 update

- Week 5 was mostly about completing the initial draft of the proposal. The relevant PR: https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-six/pull/159

- Apart from this I explored a RAG related database tool called neo4j. Did some test code to understand it correctly. Once it works fine, I will create a test code using Autogen agent. After that I will be in a position to start building the full solution.
