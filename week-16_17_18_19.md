# Week 16-19th
September 30 - October 26

- During this time I worked on improving my program which include bug fixes, implementing token counters, finetuning for 1 specific client, Prysm, as well as few other things which I am writing down below:

## Bug fixes:
- There was a bug where I was limiting number of tokens in the evidences to certain number. This made the evidence code incomplete for the LLM to judge. Now I removed all such limits so the context length could be huge but still under 200K. 

## Implemented token counter:
- To have better understanding and management of total number of tokens per requirement, I implemented a token counter which keeps track of number of tokens. This acts as a good monitoring tool to know if we are really reaching the max tokens or not. So that it will be easier to know later in case the performance is not up to the mark. 

## Call with Fredrik
- I had a call with Fredrik and discussed immediate work as well as future. 
- He suggested to check if the program works for bug finding and check the Sherlock issues which has been submitted to Prysm
- We also discussed future of this project and the fact that I would like to continue working on it post-epf which he agreed with. 

## Lean Ethereum + Consensus Conference in Cambridge (1 week)
- I attended the lean ethereum and consensus research conference in Cambridge in October. 
- I learned little but on things related to lean ethereum which involves 3SF consensus, hash based signatures, poseidon, XMSS and the current bottlenecks related to the zk advancements 
- It was also very interesting to know more about the new ideas of consensus and faster finality from Francesco
- Met several key people like Barnabe, Dankrad, Guillaume, Justin, Emile and several other lean client team members. 
- This was indeed an intense crash course to the future of ethereum that had been pretty obscure for me, 

## Comparison code
- I wrote code which takes reports of EIP/specs implementation status in two clients and produces a comparison report. 
- This is at a basic version now. 
- The better and more thorough the individual reports are the better the comparison report will become. So will focus more on making the individual reports more extensive (including some architectural design decisions in the future)
