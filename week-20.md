# Week 20
Oct 27  - Nov 2

- This week I was mostly in Cancun, Mexico attending the offsite for Prysm. 
- I could not get much work done specific to the epf work BUT I managed to get some feedback from the other prysm team members whom I met in person for the first time. 
- In short they were mostly on-board with the idea with couple of suggestions:
    - This could be turned into an audit tool 
    - Look into how spec tests work more and my project can act as a complementary
